## Introduction

This project serves as a simple yet effective way to measure and display real-time temperature data using an Arduino board, a DHT11 sensor, and a 4-digit seven segment display. The Python code interfaces with the hardware and provides a user-friendly experience to view the temperature readings.

## Hardware Components

To recreate this project, you will need the following hardware components:

- Arduino board (compatible with Arduino Uno)
- DHT11 temperature sensor
- 4-digit seven segment display
- Resistors and jumpers for circuit connections
- Breadboard (optional, for prototyping)
- Power supply or batteries (depending on your setup)

## Installation

To set up the project on your system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
2. **Connect the Hardware:** Assemble the circuit using the Arduino board, DHT11 sensor, and the 4-digit seven segment display. Make sure all connections are correct and secure.

3. **Install Required Libraries:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Install the required libraries using pip: pip install SevenSeaLibrary
4. **Upload Code to Arduino:** Upload the Arduino code (sketch) to the board using the Arduino IDE.

## Usage

1. **Power On:** Connect the Arduino board to a power supply or batteries.

2. **View Temperature:** The 4-digit seven segment display will now show the real-time temperature readings obtained from the DHT11 sensor.

3. **Interact with Python Code:** The heart of this project lies in the Python code that communicates with the Arduino and manages the temperature data. You can find the main Python script in the repository (e.g., `digital_thermometer.py`). Feel free to explore the code, modify it to suit your requirements, or add additional functionalities.

4. **Run the Python Code:** To run the Python script, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command: python digital_thermometer.py
## Coding

The Python code is well-commented and structured to make it easy for you to understand and modify. Here's a brief overview of the main components of the code:

- **Arduino Communication:** The Python code uses the Seven Sea Library to establish communication with the Arduino board, allowing it to send and receive data.

- **Temperature Readings:** The code reads temperature data from the DHT11 sensor connected to the Arduino and processes it to display on the seven segment display.
